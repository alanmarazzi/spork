;This provides default implementations for common events in Java (or the 
;native system we're operating on).  Right now, I tried to pull out common 
;methods from Swing and AWT that would be useful.

;Our goal here is to provide functions that can map a Java component into 
;one or more observables.  Additionally, we want to de-encapsulate the actual 
;event data, which is hidden by default inside of Java's methods, so that we 
;can treat event instances as abstract sequences.  To facilitate this, we 
;also build in default functionality to treat "most" java events as generic 
;IEvents, from the cljgui.events.base namespace.  We retain all of the domain
;specific data from each Java Event class, and package it as a map accessible 
;via (event-data [e]) from IEvent.

;To recap:
;  Interfacing Java with Clojure Observables entails
;  A. Extending consistent operations from the IEvent protocol to Java events 
;     so that clojure libraries can apply generic operations to observable 
;     IEvent streams.
;  B. Attaching listeners (mouse, keybord, etc.) that handle event actions 
;     by notifying observables, which are exposed to Clojure.  Attachment 
;     functions hide all the underlying Java plumbing from the caller, and 
;     simply take a Java component as input, returning a map of keyed 
;     observables as a result.  The java component is mutated as a side effect.
;  C. Define complex event routing via functional composition of Observables.
;  D. Make GUI development much less painful, but just as robust.

;;NOTE - 2017:  This was intended to wrap the wierd interface-based
;;adapter-based event system in Swing with something far more sane, based
;;off of events-as-data (as defined in my port of the F# reactive observable
;;system in events.observe).  Things have changed since 2011/12, so I'd
;;recommend possibly using a different library for swing gui work.
;;This is only maintained for legacy compatibility until some migration
;;occurs.

;The typical workflow for attaching a listener to something that produces events
;is:
;Implement a Listener interface/s relative to the events of interest
;  Typical Java interfaces are broken up into groupings of events....
;  The consistency amongst groups is that every method in the Listener interface
;  has the same signature:: SomeEvent -> void 

;  Another way of looking at it, is that are n discrete events per interface, 
;  all of which initially start with the same data type.

;  .Net handles this by publishing specific events of interest, and allowing 
;  things to subscribe to them (mutable, but also practical).

;  What'd be useful, is to implement the .Net view of things using the 
;  events described in the existing Java Listener interfaces.

;  For each interface, extract an eventname from the delineated methodnames in 
;  the listener interface.

;  For classes that support the interface, establish a mapping between the 
;  class, and the events it supports.  This allows dynamic event hookups. 

;  I.e. a JPanel supports component events, because it can attach a 
;  ComponentListener.  

;  For a given native eventful object, use an intermediate protocol to abstract
;  out the mapping of available events.

;  We need to transform an event tag, into an Observable that corresponds to 
;  (recieves notification from) the underlying Java Listener method.

;  From there, the observable framework takes over.  We just pass around 
;  data (type-hinted for the Java stuff), and use our combinators to define 
;  complex, side-effecting behavior.

;What about creating observables that interface with GUI components? 
;Components are responsible for registering subscribers themselves,

;Ideally, we'd just have a client apply a function to a GUI component and 
;get some identifiable event streams back, which they could compose using 
;observable combinators.

;We now define a library for easily converting GUI components into maps of 
;observed IEvent streams.
