;use FRP to compose a bunch of functional drawings...
;we take an initial drawing behavior (animation) and 
;a number of trails back we want to go.  The idea is that 
;we compute a new behavior, which is the composition of the 
;drawing behavior, with multiple "past" versions of itself.
;This allows us to draw a trail.  We use n to denote the number of 
;items that are trailing the original.  Note, if N is large, or if we 
;have an infinite handler, that would me we're just statically grawing 
;the shape as a function of time.  This could lead to a space leak, so 
;we might want to handle that separately....

;allow for multiple trails....n back, on the caveat that the intervals 
;exist over the domain. I.e., as we go back in "time", if t is invalid (i.e. 
;only positive values are allowed for t), then we stop trailing.
;note....interval will ultimately be multiplied by pi, so any real "difference"
;for wait should be relative to pi.  In this case, 2PI is a full cycle.
;Something that tricked me was that intuitive intervals (i.e. 1, 2 ,3) 
;seemd fine, and should produce cool trails of drawings that are animated 
;1, 2, and 3 time-steps behind the other...leaving a nice trail.
;However, the primary mover function driving most of the animation right now, 
;wiggle, projects time into a sin wave, multiplying the input value by pi.
;Thus, an interval of 20 produces the same effect as 2PI, or any other even
;multiple, while 1 produces the same effect as PI, as does 19, or any odd 
;multiple of PI.  Therefore, we need to think relative to pi (for now) to get
;meaningful transforms out of this.  Really, it's time/cycle.  That's what 
;interval should be....

;Another way around this is to just divide the cycle into n intervals, and fill
;em.  Yea, let's do that....
;This is equivalent to dividing the cycle, and taking the first n values.
